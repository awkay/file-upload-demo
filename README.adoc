= File Upload Demo

This contains a short demo that leverages Fulcro 2.0 middleware on the client to add file upload
support. This demo is a work in progress. Features:

- Creating a hand-rolled server using `mount` (instead of `component`)
- Adding http remote to client for file upload
- Adding middleware to server to receive file upload

The code is in a devcard. To run this project:

```
$ npm install
$ npx shadow-cljs watch cards
```

then in another command line:

```
$ lein repl
user=> (go)
```

then navigate to http://localhost:3000/cards.html.

The REPL supports `(restart)` to reload the server code and restart it. The client does hot code reload.
